# IOT_Security_Prototype
Security specific prototyping for IoT [Internet Of Things]

At this stage project is in incubation phase. Initially project needs to start with validating all available options for securing IoT implementations. Project execution approach is quite simple :: We will make prototype using available IoT framework/platform then look into the security aspect of the prototype. Latter results from various prototypes will merged to have a larger picture.

During next phase of the project, focus will be on generating new ideas/concepts that can improve the security of the IoT.
